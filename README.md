# My Neovim Config

Personal Neovim configuration with Lazy, language servers, completion, formatting, file explorers, and a customized UI.

## Configuration layout

- `init.lua`: bootstraps Lazy, loads plugin groups, and selects Catppuccin.
- `lua/core/options.lua`: editor options, persistent undo, indentation, clipboard, and filetype-specific spell-checking.
- `lua/core/keymaps.lua`: general editing and navigation mappings.
- `lua/plugins/ide/`: Tree-sitter, LSP, completion, formatting, and LSP memory management.
- `lua/plugins/ui/`: themes, statusline, notifications, command UI, and cursor effects.
- `lua/plugins/`: remaining editing, search, Git, and file-management plugins.
- `lazy-lock.json`: exact plugin revisions; keep this in Git for reproducible installs.

The `ide` and `ui` folders each have an `init.lua` that returns their plugin specifications. The main configuration loads these with `require("plugins.ide")` and `require("plugins.ui")`.

### Markdown and LaTeX spell-checking

Spell-checking is configured entirely in `lua/core/options.lua`; no separate `ftplugin/` folder is needed. The `WritingSpellcheck` autocommand runs on `FileType` for `markdown` and `tex`, enabling `spell` and setting `spelllang` to `en_us` locally.

Use `]s` / `[s` to navigate spelling errors, `z=` for suggestions, and `zg` to add a word to your dictionary. To disable spell-checking in the current window temporarily, run `:setlocal nospell`; enable it again with `:setlocal spell`.

## Plugins

This inventory includes configured plugins and their dependencies. Installed does not necessarily mean loaded at startup: some wait for an event or keypress. Language servers, formatters, and Tree-sitter parsers are separate tools, not additional Neovim plugins.

### Plugin management and dependencies

| Plugin | Purpose in this configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `lazy.nvim` | Installs, updates, locks, and lazy-loads plugins. |
| `plenary.nvim` | Shared Lua utilities used by Telescope and other plugins. |
| `nui.nvim` | UI components used by Noice. |
| `nvim-web-devicons` | File and filetype icons for supported UI plugins. |

### IDE features

| Plugin | Purpose in this configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `nvim-treesitter` | Parser-based syntax highlighting and indentation. Includes Lua, Python, C, Markdown, LaTeX, BibTeX, Rasi, Typst, and other configured parsers. |
| `nvim-lspconfig` | Language-server configurations for diagnostics, navigation, renaming, and code actions. |
| `mason.nvim` | Installs external language servers, formatters, and related tools. |
| `mason-lspconfig.nvim` | Bridges LSP configuration names and Mason package names. |
| `mason-tool-installer.nvim` | Ensures the configured external tools are installed. |
| `lazydev.nvim` | Lua development support for Neovim APIs and plugin type definitions; loads libraries as needed. |
| `fidget.nvim` | Displays language-server progress and status notifications. |
| `garbage-day.nvim` | Stops eligible LSP clients after Neovim loses focus for 15 minutes and restores them on return. Aggressive mode is disabled. |
| `nvim-cmp` | Completion menu combining language servers, snippets, buffer words, and paths. |
| `cmp-nvim-lsp` | LSP completion source and completion capability integration. |
| `cmp-buffer` | Suggests words from the buffer. |
| `cmp-path` | Filesystem path completion. |
| `LuaSnip` | Expands snippets and navigates their placeholders. |
| `cmp_luasnip` | Exposes LuaSnip snippets in the completion menu. |
| `friendly-snippets` | Collection of premade snippets loaded into LuaSnip. |
| `conform.nvim` | Formats on save and on demand, with LSP formatting as a fallback. |

Conform uses Stylua for Lua; isort then Black for Python; prettierd or Prettier for JavaScript; Prettier for JSX, TypeScript/TSX, HTML, CSS, JSON/JSONC, YAML, and Markdown; and shfmt for shell files. Format-on-save has a 2-second timeout. Shell formatting requests two-space indentation.

### Editing

| Plugin | Purpose in this configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `nvim-autopairs` | Automatically closes brackets and quotes, integrates with completion, and pairs `$` in TeX/plain TeX. |
| `flash.nvim` | Labeled jumps, Tree-sitter selections, enhanced character motions, and search navigation. Character-motion jump labels are disabled. |
| `treesj` | Uses Tree-sitter to split or join supported code structures. Requires a parser and a supported language. |
| `mini.nvim` | Full Mini plugin collection is installed; the individual modules below are configured separately. |
| `mini.comment` | Toggles comments, using context-aware comment strings. |
| `mini.files` | Column-based file explorer and filesystem editing. |
| `mini.surround` | Adds, removes, replaces, finds, and highlights surrounding delimiters. |
| `mini.splitjoin` | Splits and joins argument lists with `sk` and `sj`. |
| `mini.trailspace` | Detects and trims trailing whitespace. |
| `nvim-ts-context-commentstring` | Chooses comment syntax for the current Tree-sitter context, including mixed-language files. |
| `Comment.nvim` | Another commenting plugin is installed, but its spec currently has no setup call; the configured commenting module is `mini.comment`. |
| `vim-sleuth` | Detects indentation settings from files. |
| `todo-comments.nvim` | Highlights and searches configured TODO-style annotations. |
| `colorizer` (`catgoose/nvim-colorizer.lua`) | Previews color values directly in buffers. |

### Navigation and Git

| Plugin | Purpose in this configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `telescope.nvim` | Fuzzy pickers for files, text, help, diagnostics, symbols, and buffers. |
| `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` | Native fuzzy matching for Telescope; installation is conditional on `make` being available. |
| `telescope-ui-select.nvim` | Uses a Telescope dropdown for `vim.ui.select`. |
| `oil.nvim` | Edits directory contents like a text buffer; configured as the default file explorer, with hidden files shown. |
| `snacks.nvim` | Explorer, pickers, indentation guides, smooth scrolling, input UI, quick file loading, Git helpers, and configured image support. Image display depends on the terminal and external tools. |
| `gitsigns.nvim` | Displays Git changes beside lines, with customized symbols and colors. No custom hunk keybindings are configured. |
| `vim-fugitive` | Git commands inside Neovim, such as `:Git`. No custom global shortcuts are configured. |
| `which-key.nvim` | Displays available keybinding continuations; uses its automatic default setup, with no custom shortcut configured. |

### UI and themes

| Plugin | Purpose in this configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `noice.nvim` | Command-line and message UI; normal messages use the mini view and warnings/errors use Notify. Noice LSP hover and signature UI are disabled. |
| `nvim-notify` | Compact notification popups with slide animation. |
| `lualine.nvim` | Statusline showing mode, branch, filename, diagnostics, diffs, file information, location, progress, pending command keys, and a `REC @register` macro-recording indicator; configured with the Nord statusline theme. |
| `modicator.nvim` | Changes cursor-line number colors according to editor mode. |
| `smear-cursor.nvim` | Animated cursor trails, including Insert mode and window/buffer movement. |
| `catppuccin` | Current editor colorscheme. |
| `rose-pine` | Alternative colorscheme. |
| `gruvbox.nvim` | Alternative colorscheme. |
| `kanagawa.nvim` | Alternative colorscheme. |
| `solarized-osaka.nvim` | Alternative colorscheme. |

| `onedark.nvim` (`mawkler/onedark.nvim`) | Additional theme installed as a dependency of Modicator. |

## Keybindings

Both `<leader>` and `<localleader>` are **Space**. Keys are case-sensitive. `C` means Ctrl, `A`/`M` means Alt, and `S` means Shift. Modes: **N** = Normal, **V** = Visual, **S** = Select, **I** = Insert, **O** = operator-pending (after an operator such as `d`), **C** = command-line.

The tables cover mappings explicitly configured here, plus the main defaults enabled by configured editing modules. Plugin-internal default keymaps are available in each plugin's help or picker help.

### General editing — `lua/core/keymaps.lua`

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<Space>` | N, V, S | No standalone action; used as the leader prefix. |
| `<A-j>` / `<A-k>` | N, V, S | Move the current line or selection down/up and reindent. The Normal mappings also execute `gv=gv`, which reselects the previous Visual region. |
| `J` | N | Join the next line while restoring the cursor position. |
| `<C-d>` / `<C-u>` | N | Scroll half a page down/up and center the cursor. |
| `n` / `N` | N | Next/previous search match, centered and with folds opened. |
| `j` / `k` | N, V, S | Move by displayed lines, including wrapped lines. |
| `<` / `>` | V, S | Indent left/right and keep the selection. |
| `x` | N | Delete a character without overwriting registers. |
| `p` | V, S | Replace the selection without saving deleted text to the unnamed register. |
| `<leader>p` | V | Same register-preserving paste. |
| `<Esc>` | N | Clear search highlighting. |
| `Q` | N | Disabled. |
| `<leader>fp` | N | Copy the current file path to the system clipboard, with the home directory abbreviated as `~`. |
| `<leader>ss` | N | Defined here to prepare whole-file substitution of the current word, but overridden by Telescope; see conflicts below. |

### Tabs and splits — `lua/core/keymaps.lua`

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<leader>to` | N | Open a new tab. |
| `<leader>tx` | N | Close the current tab. |
| `<leader>tn` / `<leader>tp` | N | Next/previous tab. |
| `<leader>tf` | N | Open the current file in a new tab. |
| `<leader>sv` | N | Create a vertical split. |
| `<leader>sh` | N | Defined here for a horizontal split, but overridden by Telescope. |
| `<leader>se` | N | Equalize split sizes. |
| `<leader>sx` | N | Close the current split. |

The top tab bar is hidden (`showtabline = 0`); tabs still exist and these mappings still work.

### Telescope — `lua/plugins/telescope.lua`

All global mappings in this table use Normal mode.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `<leader>sh` | Search help tags. |
| `<leader>sk` | Search keybindings. |
| `<leader>sf` | Find files, including hidden files, with configured exclusions. |
| `<leader>ss` | List Telescope pickers. |
| `<leader>sw` | Search for the word under the cursor. |
| `<leader>sg` | Live grep across project files. |
| `<leader>sd` | Search diagnostics. |
| `<leader>sr` | Resume the previous picker. |
| `<leader>s.` | Find recently opened files. |
| `<leader><leader>` | Find open buffers. |
| `<leader>/` | Fuzzy search lines in the current buffer. |
| `<leader>s/` | Live grep only in open files. |

Inside a Telescope prompt in Insert mode: `<C-k>` selects the previous result, `<C-j>` the next, and `<C-l>` opens the selection. Picker help is available with `<C-/>` in Insert mode or `?` in Normal mode.

### Snacks — `lua/plugins/snacks.lua`

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<leader>lg` | N | Open Lazygit; requires the external `lazygit` executable. |
| `<leader>gl` | N | Open Lazygit log view. |
| `<leader>e` | N | Open the Snacks explorer. |
| `<leader>rN` | N | Rename the current file. |
| `<leader>dB` | N | Delete/close the current buffer, prompting as needed. |
| `<leader>pf` | N | Find files. |
| `<leader>pc` | N | Find files under the hard-coded `~/dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/lua` directory. |
| `<leader>ps` | N | Live grep. |
| `<leader>pws` | N, V | Search the current word or selected text. |
| `<leader>pk` | N | Search keybindings in an Ivy layout. |
| `<leader>gbr` | N | Pick and switch Git branches. |
| `<leader>th` | N | Pick a colorscheme; LSP inlay-hint mapping can override this locally. |
| `<leader>vh` | N | Search help pages. |
| `<leader>pt` | N | Search all configured TODO-style comments. |
| `<leader>pT` | N | Search TODO, FORGETNOT, and FIXME comments. |
| `<C-c>` | N, inside Snacks input | Close completion/cancel the input. |
| `<C-c>` | I, inside Snacks input | Close completion/leave Insert mode. |

### Files — `lua/plugins/oil.lua` and `lua/plugins/mini.lua`

| Keys | Context | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-` | N | Open the parent directory in Oil. |
| `<leader>-` | N | Toggle the floating Oil explorer. |
| `<M-h>` | Oil | Open the selected entry in a horizontal split. |
| `q` | Oil | Close the explorer. |
| `<C-h>`, `<C-c>` | Oil | Oil's default actions for these keys are disabled. |
| `<leader>ee` | N | Open Mini Files. |
| `<leader>ef` | N | Open Mini Files at the current file and reveal the working directory. |
| `<CR>` | Mini Files | Enter the directory or open the file. |
| `L` | Mini Files | Enter a directory, or open a file and close the explorer. |
| `-` | Mini Files | Go to the parent directory. |
| `H` | Mini Files | Go to the parent directory and trim the branch to the right. |

### LSP — `lua/plugins/ide/lsp.lua`

These mappings are buffer-local and become available when a language server attaches. Actions depend on server support.

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gd` | N | Find definitions through Telescope. |
| `gr` | N | Find references through Telescope. |
| `gI` | N | Find implementations through Telescope. |
| `gD` | N | Go to the declaration. |
| `<leader>D` | N | Find type definitions. |
| `<leader>ds` | N | Search symbols in the current document. |
| `<leader>ws` | N | Search symbols across the workspace. |
| `<leader>rn` | N | Rename the symbol under the cursor. |
| `<leader>ca` | N, V | Request code actions for the cursor or selection. |
| `<leader>th` | N | Toggle inlay hints, when the attached server supports them. |

### Completion and snippets — `lua/plugins/ide/autocompletion.lua`

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<C-n>` / `<C-p>` | I | Select next/previous completion. |
| `<C-b>` / `<C-f>` | I | Scroll completion documentation up/down four lines. |
| `<C-y>` | I | Accept the selected completion, or the first item if none is selected. |
| `<C-Space>` | I | Request completion manually. |
| `<C-l>` | I, S | Expand a snippet or jump to its next placeholder. |
| `<C-h>` | I, S | Jump to the previous snippet placeholder. |
| `<Tab>` | I, S | Select the next completion; otherwise expand/jump through a snippet; otherwise use the normal Tab action. |
| `<S-Tab>` | I, S | Select the previous completion; otherwise jump backward in a snippet; otherwise use the normal Shift-Tab action. |

Enter is not explicitly configured to accept completion. The configuration also inherits `nvim-cmp`'s Insert-mode preset mappings.

### Formatting and structured editing

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<leader>f` | N, V, S, O | Run Conform asynchronously; Visual mode formats the selected range. Also formats automatically before saving. |
| `<leader>cw` | N | Trim trailing whitespace with Mini Trailspace. |
| `sj` / `sk` | N, V | Join/split arguments with Mini Splitjoin. |
| `<Space>m` | N | Toggle split/join with TreeSJ. |
| `<Space>j` | N | Join a structure with TreeSJ. |
| `<Space>s` | N | Split a structure with TreeSJ. |
| `sa` + motion + delimiter | N | Add a surrounding delimiter with Mini Surround. |
| `sa` + delimiter | V | Surround the selection. |
| `ds` + delimiter | N | Delete a surrounding delimiter. |
| `sr` + old + new delimiter | N | Replace a surrounding delimiter. |
| `sf` / `sF` + delimiter | N | Find a surrounding delimiter to the right/left. |
| `sh` + delimiter | N | Highlight a surrounding delimiter. |
| `sn` | N | Change how many lines Mini Surround searches. |
| `l` / `n` suffix | Mini Surround operations | Restrict the search to the previous/next surrounding; for example, `dsl)` deletes the previous matching parentheses. |
| `gcc` | N | Toggle comment on the current line (Mini Comment default). |
| `gc` + motion | N | Toggle comments over a motion (Mini Comment default). |
| `gc` | V | Toggle comments on the selection (Mini Comment default). |
| `gc` | O | Comment text object (Mini Comment default). |
| `]t` / `[t` | N | Jump to the next/previous TODO-style comment. |

TreeSJ needs both an installed parser and language support. Its mappings are not useful in plugin-manager windows or plain text. Mini Splitjoin's default toggle mapping is disabled in favor of `sj` and `sk`.

### Flash — `lua/plugins/flash.lua`

| Keys | Mode | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zf` | N, V, O | Start a labeled Flash jump. Overrides the usual `zf` fold operator. |
| `Zf` | N, V, O | Select a Tree-sitter node with Flash. |
| `r` | O | Start a remote Flash operation. |
| `R` | O, V | Search and select a Tree-sitter range. |
| `<C-s>` | C | Toggle Flash during command-line search. |

Flash also enhances `/`, `?`, and character motions `f`, `F`, `t`, `T`, `;`, and `,`. Character jump labels are disabled, so operations such as `dts` do not need a target-label confirmation.

### Existing overlaps and context differences

These are documented as currently configured; no mappings were changed for this README.

- **`<leader>sh`**: core configuration defines horizontal split, then Telescope replaces it with help search at `VimEnter`.
- **`<leader>ss`**: core configuration defines current-word substitution, then Telescope replaces it with the picker list.
- **`<leader>th`**: globally opens the theme picker; in LSP buffers that support inlay hints, the buffer-local hint toggle takes priority.
- **`<leader>f` / `<leader>fp`**: formatting is also a prefix of copy-path, so Neovim may wait for another key before formatting.
- **`<leader>s` / `<leader>s…`**: TreeSJ split shares a prefix with search and split-window mappings.
- **`<leader>e` / `<leader>ee` / `<leader>ef`**: Snacks explorer shares a prefix with Mini Files shortcuts.
- **`<leader>p` / `<leader>pws` in Visual mode**: register-preserving paste shares a prefix with Snacks search.
- **`gr`**: the custom LSP references mapping can delay longer built-in `gr…` mappings.
- **`<leader>pc`** uses a fixed dotfiles path, not the active configuration directory discovered automatically.

To see which mapping wins, use `:verbose nmap <leader>sh` (replace the key as needed). For buffer-local LSP mappings, run this from an attached code buffer.

### Pending commands and macro recording

Incomplete Normal-mode commands appear in the statusline (`showcmd` with `showcmdloc = "statusline"`). For example, `23` appears while typing `23G` and clears when `G` executes. Start recording with `qa` (register `a`, or choose another register); `REC @a` remains visible until you press `q` to stop. Use `@a` to replay it and `@@` to repeat the last replayed macro. These are built-in keys, not custom mappings.

## Useful built-in commands

These are Neovim commands and defaults, not extra custom keybindings.

- `u` / `<C-r>`: undo/redo; persistent undo is enabled.
- `:earlier 5m` / `:later 5m`: move backward/forward through edit history.
- `:undolist`: inspect undo branches.
- `]s` / `[s`: next/previous spelling error in Markdown or TeX.
- `z=`: spelling suggestions; `zg`: add a word to the dictionary.
- `:Lazy`: plugin manager; `:Mason`: external-tool manager.
- `:ConformInfo`: inspect formatter availability and logs.
- `:checkhealth`: diagnose configuration and dependencies.
- `:messages`: message history, routed through Noice.
